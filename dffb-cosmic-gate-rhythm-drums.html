I was tired of hearing that PSVita has no games because of people frustrated with the lack of AAA games, then I made a list of good games for our beloved handheld using metacritic + videos of gameplay + playing most of the games. This list won't change the fact that Sony did a poor job in the software department, but YES! Vita DOES HAVE games! Enjoy, friends! "+++++" means I really recommend the game to anyone. \-EDIT- \-Its actually 316 Vita games now + PS Mobile + Homebrews.

Hey Guys, A couple of days ago I wrote about the problematic Rating system on the Oculus Store filtering by Rating and created a list based on a super simple calculation of total number of Stars. Original post can be found here (https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/891lvx/all_rift_experiences_ordered_by_rating_actual/). A few smart people around here pointed out the flaw of my simplistic rating approach and pointed to some great information. I ended up using /u/Rrdro suggestion.

Going through the Browse All section and Filtering by Rating, at the top of the list there are tens of experiences with only a few ratings or just a single 5 star rating, when experiences with hundreds of 5 star ratings are buried down the list, and with over 900 experiences for Rift it's pretty easy to miss the top experiences of all times. ampnbsp; I wrote a little something to analyze.

Peyote is a plant that I have always held great reverence for. It's extremely rare for one thing, holding a spot on the endangered species list. It can take five years or more to cultivate a single peyote “button” with enough potency of the active ingredient mescaline to produce a single dose. The only individuals allowed to legally consume it are participants in clinical studies or members of the Native American Church. I never thought I'd get the chance, not until a high school friend. Gary was the oldest of his brothers. He was tall for his age--only thirteen and a half--a foot taller than his small, squat of a mother; cursed with the unfortunate arrangement of features that left his face to rest in a befuddled state, he was a fierce, intelligent boy, nonetheless. Gary already had crooked teeth and liked listening to death metal. Specifically, he was fond of a Norwegian outfit named after a horrible nightmare that all the members claimed to have had separately before forming.
