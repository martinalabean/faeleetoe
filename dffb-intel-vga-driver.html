I was updating the drivers for my Asus Z97-K driver, all was well until I tried updating the VGA driver, every time I try run the install I get a error along the lines of "This computer does not meet the minimum requirements for installing this software."

When I reboot with that, it crashes/shuts down at the point the blue background loads. I've even tried Win 10 - and the same happens. I can add all Win 7 drivers in the Lenovo update - and its fine - just it dies with the Graphics driver. The machine never. 
I just built a new computer with a Z370 Taichi that I'm trying to connect to a Dell U2713HM. Windows 10 Pro is the OS and I've installed the necessary Intel VGA drivers. I've tried using a modern HDMI cable and a DVI-D to HDMI cable and both are limiting the resolution to 1920x1080.
