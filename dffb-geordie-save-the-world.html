Geordie Shore legend Aaron Chalmers reveals surprise career plans after he retires from MMA. Chalmers has already left one career as a reality TV star on Geordie Shore to take up mixed martial. When I was a child my parents used to take me to spend every Easter with my Auntie Jane in a village called Birkenby in the Cheviot Hills of Northumberland. Auntie Jane was my mum’s older sister, a plump, red-faced woman who had been the first in our family to go to university and had married a Geordie businessman who, having made a fortune early on in his career, retired early and left his hometown for the peace and tranquility of the countryside.
