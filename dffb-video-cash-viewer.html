The FloSports Problem I’m as surprised as many of you of how quickly FloSports has taken over the North American soccer circle. First, it began as the exclusive local partner of D.C. United, which was surprising given that the far more accessible NBC Sports Washington was offering to broadcast D.C. United games (https://awfulannouncing.com/soccer/d-c-united-shucking-traditional-local-tv-deal-will-instead-stream-games-through-flosports.html)(though probably with a less lucrative deal, given. My experience with the Longmont Potion Castle documentary “Where in the Hell is the Lavender House” was really disappointing. I’ve been listening to LPC’s calls for almost 20 years. I’ve waited two years for this documentary to come out, and along with other true LPC fans, I love to hear more about his work and what he does and how it all comes together. I can’t begin to describe the disappointment I felt as this documentary began to unfold before my eyes yesterday, but I will do my best. # May 2019 - Post MLS Board of Governors Meeting Welcome to the May MLS thread.

Hey everyone - Today I bought a couple Blu-Rays (Dunkirk, Chinatown) for the first time in YEARS. Part of the reason for me buying them is definitely the influence of listening to Griffin amp David talking about whatever recent Criterion piece they’ve added to their respective collections, that kind of thing. I’m simultaneously a big physical media guy/anal retentive collector (vinyl, books) and also someone who doesn’t like “unnecessary” clutter (my brain is fighting itself) Four years ago I made a ranty, lengthy response to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/stormchasing/comments/31ayh9/tips_for_a_beginner/ , at the time it seemed pretty well received. So, with the number of "any tips for a newbie/beginner" posts, that inevitably come around, I've decided to revisit this post and remake it here in hope that it will serve as an initial source of information. Maybe other sources of various experience levels can hop in and give their opinions too. Maybe

Hi everyone! I spent all night reading through these yesterday, some of these stories are truly bizarre. It inspired me to write about an incident that normally, I hate to even talk about because it is honestly one of the most disturbing things that I have ever experienced. This all started in January of 2019, so it’s pretty recent. For some background context, I am a young gay man living in a very populated city, so weird things are bound to happen, especially when using the gay dating. This scenario was inspired by a fusion in my head from a couple different real world news articles and lots of conspiracy theory. Any groups that seem to be part of real world lore are only coincidental. The Hook: The Handler summons the agents to Reno, Nevada to help cover up loose ends. The scenario involves a former producer of Phenomenon-X who now is a frequent guest on a Nevada conspiracy theory podcast called Truth Seekers named Allen Eddington. Delta Green gets the agents get involve. Yesterday, I was invited out by a friend of mine who wanted me to network with another friend who was having difficulties on the YouTube front. I checked out some of his videos before and I had a fair idea of what I was working with, but there wasn't any specific agenda in mind when we met for dinner. What evolved from that evening is, in my opinion, the quintessential representation of the average NewTuber, the journey and struggle they go through, and the pathway forward. 
I've seen a lot of people marvel at how it seems like the YouTube algorithm seems to favor right wing content and pushes it relentlessly when you stumble into certain topics or watch one too many funny compilation videos. Often this is treated as something bordering a Google conspiracy or there's some trick the reactionaries are exploiting - but I'm here to explain that it's the inevitable result of how the algorithm works in the late 2010s (note it does shift somewhat regularly). I am hoping. I posted on here a little while ago asking for help finding the original Clarity Live album booklet. In my memory it included a track by track breakdown of the album. I think that my memory was wrong. I was spurred into searching for the breakdown afresh today.and I found it! This is from an archived page on the band's website and may have been an email campaign to fans.
